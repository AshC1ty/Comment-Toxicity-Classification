# Toxic Comments Classification

This project is designed to train a machine learning model for classifying toxic comments. The project utilizes Tensorflow, Pandas and Matplotlib and the Sequential Model API to analyze and categorize user-generated text. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation. The dataset consists of labeled comments, distinguishing between toxic and non-toxic content. The model can be used to automatically identify harmful language in online discussions. Performance metrics and visualization tools are incorporated to assess model accuracy and effectiveness. Gradio is used to create a UI to classify custome user inputs.
